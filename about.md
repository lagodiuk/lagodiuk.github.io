I have experience of solving the different kinds of technical problems: systems design, scalability of backend services, performance optimization.

I prefer algorithmic approach for solving problems. Additionally, I make use of data-driven approach and domain-specific insights about the nature of problems.

Currently I am working in company [HERE](https://company.here.com/here/). 
In my daily work I focused on development of search and ranking functionality of [Geocoding
service](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/geocoder).
