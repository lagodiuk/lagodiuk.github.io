I have experience of solving the wide range of technical problems: systems design, scalability, performance
optimization. 

I prefer algorithmic approach in order to attack problems, but I also appreciate the data-driven approach, and
domain-specific insights about the nature of problems.

Currently I am working in company [HERE](https://company.here.com/here/). 
In my daily work I focused on development of search and ranking functionality of [Geocoding
service](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/geocoder).
