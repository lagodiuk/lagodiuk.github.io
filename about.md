I have experience of solving various technical problems (systems design, scalability, performance optimization).
For solving of problems I apply an algorithmic approach, based on analysis of existing data and domain-specific knowledge.

Currently I am working in company [HERE](https://company.here.com/here/).

Activities, which I like to do in my free time: 
- Develop Open-source hobby projects: [link to my GitHub profile](https://github.com/lagodiuk)
- Solve Competitive Programming problems on SPOJ: [link to my SPOJ profile](http://www.spoj.com/users/stemm/)
- Help other programmers on Stackoverflow: [link to my profile on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/653511/stemm?tab=profile)

Expressed opinions are my own.
